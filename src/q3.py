"""
This question has two parts:

Part 1: Please implement these stub functions to match the documentation.
It will be useful to use a dict to store the "threshold" for each tax bracket, 
and use an appropriate control structure to go over it and find the right tax bracket.

Part 2: The California, New York, and Federal tax functions should have code in common.
Factor it out into a helper function, so that the code is not repeated, but the functionality
remains the same.

As always, make sure to implement tests in the tests directory.
